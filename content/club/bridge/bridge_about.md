# In brief <a id="chapter-1"></a>
ENSIAS Bridge is a club founded in 2010 by student visionaries for "Uniting Generations, Sharing Experiences and Creating Pathways to Excellence"

# Nice, but how? <a id="chapter-2"></a>
Bridging gaps between ENSIASts alumni and students! By bringing experiences that open doors to the professional world: We understand the passage from student to laureate - the twists and turns, and the choices to be made. We learn from the journey, share the wisdom, and face the challenges as a family. 

This mission is concretized by our projects:
